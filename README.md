# Autoencoder Image Compression
## Description
Image datasets for machine learning take a lot of space. Let's see if we can minimize that.\
\
This project aims to use a convolutional autoencoder, prinicpal component analysis, quantization, and entropy coding to compress images without while maintaining the image quality.
